Use Kinesis to store the transaction information. The billing application will consume data from the stream, the audit application can consume the same data several hours later.<br> <br> </div> <b>Explanation</b><br><div style="font-size: 15px;"><p>Correct answer is <strong>D</strong> as the key point here is batch application and message being stored durably and delivery guarantee. Kinesis can store the data durably and allow access to multiple consumers without any dependencies. </p><p>Refer AWS documentation - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/" target="_blank">Kinesis Data Streams</a> </p><p><em>Q: How does Amazon Kinesis Data Streams differ from Amazon SQS?</em> </p><p><em>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time processing of streaming big data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).</em> </p><p><em>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated workflows.</em> </p><p><em>Q: When should I use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and when should I use Amazon SQS?</em> </p><p><em>We recommend Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for use cases with requirements that are similar to the following:</em> </p><ul> <li><em>Routing related records to the same record processor (as in streaming MapReduce). For example, counting and aggregation are simpler when all records for a given key are routed to the same record processor.</em></li> <li><em>Ordering of records. For example, you want to transfer log data from the application host to the processing/archival host while maintaining the order of log statements.</em></li> <li><em>Ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. For example, you have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.</em></li> <li><em>Ability to consume records in the same order a few hours later. For example, you have a billing application and an audit application that runs a few hours behind the billing application. Because Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stores data for up to 7 days, you can run the audit application up to 7 days behind the billing application.</em></li> </ul><p><em>We recommend Amazon SQS for use cases with requirements that are similar to the following:</em> </p><p><em></em> </p><ul> <li><em>Messaging semantics (such as message-level ack/fail) and visibility timeout. For example, you have a queue of work items and want to track the successful completion of each item independently. Amazon SQS tracks the ack/fail, so the application does not have to maintain a persistent checkpoint/cursor. Amazon SQS will delete acked messages and redeliver failed messages after a configured visibility timeout.</em></li> <li><em>Individual message delay. For example, you have a job queue and need to schedule individual jobs with a delay. With Amazon SQS, you can configure individual messages to have a delay of up to 15 minutes.</em></li> <li><em>Dynamically increasing concurrency/throughput at read time. For example, you have a work queue and want to add more readers until the backlog is cleared. With Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can scale up to a sufficient number of shards (note, however, that you'll need to provision enough shards ahead of time).</em></li> <li><em>Leveraging Amazon SQS’s ability to scale transparently. For example, you buffer requests and the load changes as a result of occasional load spikes or the natural growth of your business. Because each buffered request can be processed independently, Amazon SQS can scale transparently to handle the load without any provisioning instructions from you.</em></li> </ul><p>Option A is wrong as SQS chaining would create dependency among the consumers. If one consumer fails, the message would not be available for the other consumer impacting the availability. </p><p>Option B is wrong as although possible is error prone and needs to maintain the position read by the application. </p><p>Option C is wrong as with DynamoDB delivery guarantee needs to handled by application as well is not a cost effective solution. </p> <a href="mailto:certification.exam.tests@gmail.com?subject=AWS%20SAP-C01%20Practice%20Test%201%20-%20%23120390">AWS SAP-C01 Question feedback</a></div></div></div><div class="question_info"><div class="question_no"><b>Question : 2 of 55 </b><small>- Multiple Choice</small> <span style="float:right;" class="grad_5248663"> <span class="label label-success">Graded</span> </span> </div><div class="question_detail"> Your company is migrating infrastructure to AWS.

In a gas heater, a small flame that’s always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. </em> </p><p><em>This scenario is similar to a backup-and-restore scenario.

This is the critical core of the system (the pilot light) around which all other infrastructure pieces in AWS (the rest of the furnace) can quickly be provisioned to restore the complete system. </em> </p><p><em>To provision the remainder of the infrastructure to restore business-critical services, you would typically have some preconfigured servers bundled as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which are ready to be started up at a moment’s notice.

A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running.

Since X-Forwarded-For is used in HTTP headers only, you could not obtain the clients IP address if the ELB was configured for TCP load balancing. Many of you told us that you wanted similar functionality for TCP traffic, so we added support for Proxy Protocol. It simply prepends a human readable header with the clients connection information to the TCP data sent to your server. The advantage of Proxy Protocol is that it can be used with any protocol layer above TCP, since it has no knowledge of the higher-level protocol that is used on top of the connection. Proxy Protocol is useful when you are serving non-HTTP traffic. </em><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><em></em><br></span> </p> <a href="mailto:certification.exam.tests@gmail.com?subject=AWS%20SAP-C01%20Practice%20Test%201%20-%20%23120516">AWS SAP-C01 Question feedback</a></div></div></div><div class="question_info"><div class="question_no"><b>Question : 21 of 55 </b><small>- Multiple Choice</small> <span style="float:right;" class="grad_5248682"> <span class="label label-success">Graded</span> </span> </div><div class="question_detail"> You are running a successful multi-tier web application on AWS and your marketing department has asked you to add a reporting tier to the application.

After several months, the product grows even more popular and you need additional capacity. As a result, your company purchases two c3.2xlarge medium utilization RIs. You register the two c3.2xlarge instances with your ELB and quickly find that the m1.large instances are at 100% of capacity and the c3.2xlarge instances have significant capacity that’s unused. Which option is the most cost effective and uses EC2 capacity most effectively?<br><div class="pull-left"><div class="label-danger label" style="padding: .2em .6em .3em;">Incorrect</div></div><div class="pull-right"><b style="font-size: 15px;">Time spent : 6 sec </b></div><br><br> <b>Your answer</b><br><div style="font-size: 15px;"> <b>A</b>. <input type="radio" disabled="">&nbsp;Use a separate ELB for each instance type and distribute load to ELBs with Route 53 weighted round robin<br><b>B</b>. <input type="radio" disabled="">&nbsp;Configure Autoscaling group and Launch Configuration with ELB to add up to 10 more on-demand m1.large instances when triggered by CloudWatch shut off c3.2xlarge instances<br><b>C</b>. <input type="radio" disabled="">&nbsp;Route traffic to EC2 m1.large and c3.2xlarge instances directly using Route 53 latency based routing and health checks shut off ELB<br><span class="bgcolor"><b>D</b>. <input type="radio" checked="true" disabled="">&nbsp;Configure ELB with two c3.2xlarge Instances and use on-demand Autoscaling group for up to two additional c3.2xlarge instances.

Use a separate ELB for each instance type and distribute load to ELBs with Route 53 weighted round robin<br> <br> </div> <b>Explanation</b><br><div style="font-size: 15px;"><p>Main issue is the load is not getting distributed evenly across the instances.
